TASK
Estimate a probability distribution over all admissible outcome categories for the following question.

Apply rigorous probabilistic reasoning. Prioritize base rates, explicit uncertainty quantification, and grounding claims in the provided evidence packet.

EVIDENCE-BASED RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
- Use ONLY the information in the EVIDENCE PACKET provided below.
- Do NOT use external knowledge, memory of events, or assumptions about information not in the packet.
- If your prior knowledge CONFLICTS with the evidence packet, treat the EVIDENCE PACKET AS AUTHORITATIVE.
- Treat ALL clauses in the resolution criteria and fine print as BINDING.
- You MUST output a valid probability distribution: all p_i ∈ (0,1) and sum = 1.00 exactly.
- Avoid extremes <0.02 or >0.98 for any single category unless resolution is near-certain from packet evidence.
- Be analytic and concise.

UNDERSTANDING THE EVIDENCE STRUCTURE
The packet organizes evidence BY OPTION:
- FOR each option: Evidence supporting that option winning.
- AGAINST each option: Evidence challenging that option.
- Evidence strength rating per option (from curator).
- NEUTRAL: Background on selection process.

EVIDENCE DISCIPLINE
- For each category driver and each adjustment:
  (i) cite the evidence item ID (e.g., [A1-FOR], [B2-AGAINST]), AND
  (ii) note its credibility tier.
- If making an inference beyond explicit statements, label it "inference" and justify.
- If evidence is insufficient to justify an adjustment, keep the adjustment small.
- Do NOT treat multiple items from the same CLUSTER as independent support.

EVIDENCE WEIGHTING PRINCIPLES
- Weight by: source credibility (Tier), recency, direct relevance, independence.
- Curator's "leading options" is descriptive—your distribution MAY differ if reasoning supports it.

REQUIRED REASONING STEPS (FOLLOW IN ORDER)
1) Rephrase: State what is being predicted and list all admissible outcome categories verbatim. State the close date.
2) Key criteria & dates: List exact conditions that determine each category outcome and relevant deadlines.
   Include exact quoted resolution triggers where possible.
3) Evidence inventory: For each option, count FOR/AGAINST items and note evidence strength rating.
   List key unknowns from packet.
4) Outside view: Using BASE RATE EVIDENCE if available, propose base-rate distribution across categories.
   State confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW.
   If no base rate evidence, use uniform distribution or analogous reference class.
5) Inside view:
   - For each category: list 1–2 strongest reasons it could occur (cite evidence IDs, tiers).
   - Time remaining: What could plausibly change before close?
   - Dominant causal forces given the evidence.
6) Adjustments: Starting from base-rate distribution, make 2–4 explicit adjustments.
   State which categories gain or lose probability mass and by how much (percentage points).
   Each adjustment must cite evidence IDs.
   After each adjustment, verify probabilities still sum to 1.00.
7) Uncertainty & calibration check:
   - Am I overweighting vivid details or recent events?
   - Am I anchoring on curator's "leading options"?
   - Is my distribution appropriately diffuse given uncertainty?
   - If evidence is thin, shrink toward base rate distribution.
