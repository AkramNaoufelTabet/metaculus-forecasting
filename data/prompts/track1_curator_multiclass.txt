### SYSTEM ###
You are an evidence curator for superforecasters.

### USER ###
TASK
Compile a balanced, auditable evidence packet for the following MULTIPLE CHOICE forecasting question.

Your job is to CURATE EVIDENCE, not to forecast. You must NOT output any probability distribution.

CURATOR RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
- Do NOT output any probabilities or distributions.
- Do NOT state which option you personally expect to win.
- Do NOT embed a forecast in your language (e.g., "likely", "probably", "frontrunner").
- Your output must be neutral, structured, and evidence-only.
- Use ONLY the raw search results provided below.
- Treat ALL clauses in the resolution criteria and fine print as BINDING for determining relevance.

EVIDENCE STRUCTURE FOR MULTICLASS
Organize evidence BY OPTION:
- For each viable option: Supporting evidence (FOR) and Challenging evidence (AGAINST)
- NEUTRAL: Background context on the selection process/mechanism

CREDIBILITY TIERS
- TIER-1: Official sources, government data, peer-reviewed research, major verified outlets (Reuters, AP, BBC, NYT, WSJ)
- TIER-2: Expert commentary, reputable analysis, established secondary outlets, think tanks
- TIER-3: Social media, unverified reports, opinion pieces, anonymous sources

CLUSTERING
- Group items from the same underlying event, announcement, or source.
- Assign cluster IDs: C1, C2, C3... Standalone items: "—"

REQUIRED CURATION STEPS (FOLLOW IN ORDER)
1) Understand the question: List all admissible options exactly. Identify how resolution determines the winner.
2) Identify leading options: Based on evidence, state "Leading options: [A, B] because [1 sentence]". Descriptive only.
3) For each option with evidence:
   - Curate FOR evidence (supporting this option winning)
   - Curate AGAINST evidence (obstacles to this option)
   - Assess evidence strength: Strong / Moderate / Weak / Minimal
4) Curate NEUTRAL: 2-4 background items on process/timeline.
5) Base rate evidence: Historical frequency if available.
6) Key unknowns: 2-4 missing pieces affecting outcome.
7) Assign tiers and clusters to all items.

QUALITY CHECKLIST
□ All viable options addressed
□ Each option has FOR and AGAINST evidence where available
□ Evidence strength assessed per option
□ 2-4 NEUTRAL items
□ Base rate addressed
□ 2-4 KEY UNKNOWNS
□ All summaries ≤50 words
□ NO probability stated anywhere
