TASK
Estimate a point prediction and 80% confidence interval for the numeric quantity specified in the following question.

Apply rigorous probabilistic reasoning. Prioritize base rates, explicit uncertainty quantification, and grounding claims in the provided evidence packet.

EVIDENCE-BASED RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
- Use ONLY the information in the EVIDENCE PACKET provided below.
- Do NOT use external knowledge, memory of events, or assumptions about information not in the packet.
- If your prior knowledge CONFLICTS with the evidence packet, treat the EVIDENCE PACKET AS AUTHORITATIVE.
- Treat ALL clauses in the resolution criteria and fine print as BINDING.
- You MUST output: a point estimate (median), a 10th percentile (P10), and a 90th percentile (P90).
- The interval [P10, P90] must contain 80% of your subjective probability mass.
- Ensure P10 < median < P90.
- Respect any bounds specified in the resolution criteria.
- Express all values in the CANONICAL UNITS specified below.
- Be analytic and concise.

UNDERSTANDING THE EVIDENCE STRUCTURE
The packet organizes evidence by direction:
- HIGH: Evidence supporting higher values.
- LOW: Evidence supporting lower values.
- NEUTRAL: Methodology, definitions, measurement context.
- ESTIMATES: Explicit numeric estimates from sources (critical anchor points).
- HISTORICAL DATA: Past values of this metric.

EVIDENCE DISCIPLINE
- For each directional driver and each adjustment:
  (i) cite the evidence item ID (e.g., [H2], [L3]), AND
  (ii) note its credibility tier.
- If making an inference beyond explicit statements, label it "inference" and justify.
- If evidence is insufficient to justify an adjustment, acknowledge and widen uncertainty.

EVIDENCE WEIGHTING PRINCIPLES
- Weight ESTIMATES heavily by source credibility (official > expert > other).
- Anchor on TIER-1 estimates if available.
- Use HISTORICAL DATA to calibrate interval width.

REQUIRED REASONING STEPS (FOLLOW IN ORDER)
1) Rephrase: Define the exact quantity to estimate, its units, and state the resolution/close date.
2) Key criteria & dates: List exact measurement specifications and relevant deadlines.
   Include exact quoted resolution triggers where possible. Note any bounds (floor/ceiling).
3) Evidence inventory: List all ESTIMATES from packet with sources and tiers.
   Count HIGH/LOW/NEUTRAL items. Note historical data range if available.
4) Outside view: Using HISTORICAL DATA and BASE RATE evidence, propose base estimate and typical range.
   State distribution shape assumption if relevant (normal, log-normal, etc.).
   State confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW.
5) Inside view:
   - At least 3 strongest reasons for HIGHER values (cite evidence IDs, tiers).
   - At least 3 strongest reasons for LOWER values (cite evidence IDs, tiers).
   - Time remaining: What could plausibly change before resolution?
   - Dominant causal forces given the evidence.
6) Adjustments: Starting from base estimate, make 2–4 explicit adjustments.
   State direction and magnitude in the same units as the outcome.
   Each adjustment must cite evidence IDs.
   Separately note any adjustments to interval width (uncertainty).
7) Uncertainty & calibration check:
   - Am I overweighting vivid details or recent events?
   - Am I anchoring too heavily on a single estimate?
   - Am I underweighting historical variance?
   - Is my 80% interval wide enough? (Forecasters are typically overconfident.)
   - If evidence is thin or conflicting, widen the interval.
