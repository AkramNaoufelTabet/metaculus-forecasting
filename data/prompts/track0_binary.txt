TASK
Estimate the probability that the following question resolves YES.

Apply rigorous probabilistic reasoning. Prioritize base rates, explicit uncertainty quantification, and grounding claims in provided evidence.

CLOSED-BOOK RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
- Use ONLY the information explicitly provided in the question, background, 
  and resolution criteria, plus general world knowledge up to your training cutoff.
- For any events AFTER your training cutoff, assume NO new information 
  unless explicitly stated in the provided text.
- NO web browsing, NO news, NO tools, NO assumptions about unseen events.
- If provided text CONFLICTS with your prior knowledge, treat PROVIDED TEXT AS AUTHORITATIVE.
- Treat ALL clauses in the resolution criteria and fine print as BINDING.
- You MUST output a probability p ∈ (0,1). Avoid extremes <0.02 or >0.98 unless resolution is near-certain from provided information.
- Be analytic and concise.

EVIDENCE DISCIPLINE
- For each YES/NO driver and each adjustment:
  (i) quote a short supporting snippet from the provided text, OR
  (ii) label it as "prior knowledge" and briefly state the domain/source.
- If evidence is insufficient to justify an adjustment, acknowledge this and keep the adjustment small.

REQUIRED REASONING STEPS (FOLLOW IN ORDER)
1) Rephrase: Define what "YES" means and state the close date.
2) Key criteria & dates: List exact conditions for YES and relevant deadlines.
   Include exact quoted resolution triggers where possible.
3) Outside view: Identify a reference class with sufficient historical instances;
   propose an explicit base rate with brief justification.
   State confidence in base rate: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW.
4) Inside view:
   - At least 3 strongest reasons for NO (with evidence tags).
   - At least 3 strongest reasons for YES (with evidence tags).
   - Time remaining: What could plausibly change before close?
   - Dominant causal forces given ONLY provided information.
5) Adjustments: Starting from base rate, make 2–4 explicit adjustments.
   State direction and magnitude (in percentage points or as odds multiplier).
   Each adjustment must have an evidence tag.
6) Uncertainty & calibration check: 
   - Am I overweighting vivid details or recent events?
   - Am I anchoring on arbitrary numbers in the text?
   - Am I underweighting base rates?
   - If base rate confidence is LOW or evidence is thin, shrink toward base rate.
