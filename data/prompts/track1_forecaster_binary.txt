TASK
Estimate the probability that the following question resolves YES.

Apply rigorous probabilistic reasoning. Prioritize base rates, explicit uncertainty quantification, and grounding claims in the provided evidence packet.

EVIDENCE-BASED RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
- Use ONLY the information in the EVIDENCE PACKET provided below.
- Do NOT use external knowledge, memory of events, or assumptions about information not in the packet.
- If your prior knowledge CONFLICTS with the evidence packet, treat the EVIDENCE PACKET AS AUTHORITATIVE.
- Treat ALL clauses in the resolution criteria and fine print as BINDING.
- You MUST output a probability p ∈ (0,1). Avoid extremes <0.02 or >0.98 unless resolution is near-certain from packet evidence.
- Be analytic and concise.

UNDERSTANDING THE EVIDENCE STRUCTURE
The packet uses a Red Team / Blue Team structure:
- BLUE (Prevailing): Evidence supporting the dominant/expected outcome.
- RED (Contrary): Evidence challenging the prevailing view.
- NEUTRAL: Background context.
- DOMINANCE RATING: Curator's assessment of evidence balance (guardrail, not forecast).

EVIDENCE DISCIPLINE
- For each YES/NO driver and each adjustment:
  (i) cite the evidence item ID (e.g., [B3], [R2]), AND
  (ii) note its color (BLUE/RED/NEUTRAL) and credibility tier.
- If making an inference beyond explicit statements, label it "inference" and justify.
- If evidence is insufficient to justify an adjustment, keep the adjustment small.
- Do NOT treat multiple items from the same CLUSTER as independent support.

EVIDENCE WEIGHTING PRINCIPLES
- Weight by: source credibility (Tier), recency, direct relevance to resolution criteria, independence.
- Do NOT inflate RED evidence weight simply because it's labeled contrary.
- Curator dominance rating is a guardrail—your probability MAY differ if reasoning supports it.

REQUIRED REASONING STEPS (FOLLOW IN ORDER)
1) Rephrase: Define what "YES" means and state the close date.
2) Key criteria & dates: List exact conditions for YES and relevant deadlines.
   Include exact quoted resolution triggers where possible.
3) Evidence inventory: Count BLUE/RED/NEUTRAL items. State curator dominance rating.
   Note your independent assessment (may agree or disagree). List key unknowns.
4) Outside view: Using BASE RATE EVIDENCE if available, propose reference class and base rate.
   State confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW.
   If no base rate evidence, state this and use 0.5 or analogous implicit reference class.
5) Inside view:
   - At least 3 strongest reasons for NO (cite evidence IDs, tiers, clusters).
   - At least 3 strongest reasons for YES (cite evidence IDs, tiers, clusters).
   - Time remaining: What could plausibly change before close (based ONLY on packet)?
   - Dominant causal forces given the evidence.
6) Adjustments: Starting from base rate, make 2–4 explicit adjustments.
   State direction and magnitude (percentage points or odds multiplier).
   Each adjustment must cite evidence IDs.
   Do NOT double-count clustered items.
7) Uncertainty & calibration check:
   - Am I overweighting vivid or recent RED evidence?
   - Am I anchoring on the curator dominance rating instead of independent reasoning?
   - Am I double-counting evidence from the same cluster?
   - Have I accounted for KEY UNKNOWNS in my uncertainty?
   - If evidence is thin or conflicting, shrink toward base rate.
