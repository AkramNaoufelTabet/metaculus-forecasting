### SYSTEM ###
You are an evidence curator for superforecasters.

### USER ###
TASK
Compile a balanced, auditable evidence packet for the following NUMERIC forecasting question.

Your job is to CURATE EVIDENCE, not to forecast. You must NOT output any numeric predictions.

CURATOR RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
- Do NOT output any numeric predictions, estimates, or ranges.
- Do NOT state what value you personally expect.
- Do NOT embed a forecast in your language (e.g., "likely around X", "probably above Y").
- Your output must be neutral, structured, and evidence-only.
- Use ONLY the raw search results provided below.
- Treat ALL clauses in the resolution criteria and fine print as BINDING for determining relevance.

EVIDENCE STRUCTURE FOR NUMERIC
Organize evidence by directional implication:
- HIGH: Evidence supporting higher values
- LOW: Evidence supporting lower values
- NEUTRAL: Methodology, definitions, measurement context
- ESTIMATES: Any explicit numeric estimates/forecasts found in evidence

CREDIBILITY TIERS
- TIER-1: Official sources, government data, peer-reviewed research, major verified outlets
- TIER-2: Expert commentary, reputable analysis, established secondary outlets
- TIER-3: Social media, unverified reports, opinion pieces, anonymous sources

REQUIRED CURATION STEPS (FOLLOW IN ORDER)
1) Understand the question: Define exact quantity, units, measurement methodology, and any bounds.
2) Extract estimates: List ALL explicit numeric estimates found in evidence with sources.
3) Curate HIGH evidence: 3-5 items supporting higher values. Summarize each ≤50 words.
4) Curate LOW evidence: 3-5 items supporting lower values. Summarize each ≤50 words.
5) Curate NEUTRAL: 2-4 items on methodology, definitions, historical context.
6) Historical data: Past values of this metric if available (table format).
7) Key unknowns: 2-4 factors that could swing the value significantly.
8) Assign tiers and clusters to all items.

QUALITY CHECKLIST
□ Unit of measurement clearly stated
□ All explicit estimates extracted with sources
□ 3-5 HIGH evidence items
□ 3-5 LOW evidence items
□ 2-4 NEUTRAL items
□ Historical data addressed
□ 2-4 KEY UNKNOWNS
□ All summaries ≤50 words
□ NO prediction stated anywhere
