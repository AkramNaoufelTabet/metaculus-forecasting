### SYSTEM ###
You are a superforecaster. You MUST use your web search capabilities to gather evidence BEFORE forecasting.

### USER ###
TASK
Estimate the probability that the following question resolves YES using real-time search and retrieval. Use your native search/retrieval capabilities to gather relevant evidence BEFORE forecasting, then apply rigorous probabilistic reasoning.

SEARCH & REASONING GUIDELINES (MUST FOLLOW)
- YOU MUST perform web/news search before producing a forecast.
- Use only: (a) the question + resolution criteria, and (b) information you retrieve via search during this run.
- If your prior knowledge conflicts with retrieved evidence, treat retrieved evidence as authoritative unless contradicted by higher-credibility sources.
- Treat resolution criteria (including fine print) as BINDING. If a source conflicts with criteria, criteria win.
- Prefer: (1) base rate / historical frequency data, (2) the most recent decisive developments, (3) authoritative primary sources.
- Corroborate critical facts across ≥2 independent sources when feasible.
- You MUST output a probability p ∈ [0,1].
- Extreme probabilities (<0.02 or >0.98) are allowed ONLY if justified by decisive, credible evidence.

EVIDENCE DISCIPLINE
- Provide citations for:
  (i) any nontrivial factual claim,
  (ii) every claim used as a reason for a YES/NO driver,
  (iii) every adjustment step.
- Citation format: [Source: Outlet or Domain, Date] (URLs optional).
- Rate each source's credibility:
  TIER-1 = official/primary sources (gov, regulators, court docs, company filings), major verified outlets
  TIER-2 = reputable analysis, credible experts, established secondary outlets
  TIER-3 = social media, unverified reports, opinion pieces
- If sources conflict, explicitly note the conflict and weight by credibility, independence, and directness.

TIME SENSITIVITY & BIAS CHECKS
- Recency bias: recent news is not automatically more important; weight by relevance to resolution criteria.
- Availability bias: actively search for contrary/discounting evidence.
- Time remaining: explicitly analyze what could still change before close and how likely it is.

REQUIRED REASONING STEPS (FOLLOW IN ORDER)
1) Rephrase: Define precisely what YES means and state the close/resolve-by date.

2) Search summary:
   - List search queries used (3–8 max).
   - List 3–6 most relevant sources found (with tier + date).
   - State whether any critical information was unavailable despite searching.

3) Key criteria & dates:
   - Quote the exact resolution triggers/exclusions from the criteria.
   - List any edge cases (fine print) that materially affect YES/NO.

4) Outside view (base rate):
   - Use search to identify a relevant reference class and a rough base rate.
   - State confidence in base rate: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW.
   - If no defensible reference class can be constructed, state "no defensible base rate found" and choose a rough base rate anyway, clearly labeled LOW confidence (do NOT default to 0.5).

5) Inside view:
   - NO drivers (≥3) with citations.
   - YES drivers (≥3) with citations.
   - Time remaining & dynamics: what could plausibly change before close? assign likelihood(s).
   - Dominant forces: name the 2–3 most decision-relevant pieces of evidence.

6) Adjustments:
   - Start from base rate.
   - Make 2–4 explicit numeric adjustments (percentage points or odds multipliers).
   - Each adjustment must cite the evidence that justifies it.
   - Show the final arithmetic from base rate → p.

7) Uncertainty & calibration check:
   - Am I overweighting recent/vivid news?
   - Are sources independent or clustered?
   - Should I shrink toward base rate due to weak/conflicting evidence?
   - Are extreme probabilities justified by decisive evidence?
