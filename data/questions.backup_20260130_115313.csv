41333,"What will be the combined capex for Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon during the fourth quarter of 2025?
",https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41333/what-will-be-the-combined-capex-for-microsoft-alphabet-amazon-for-q4-2025/,"Known as hyperscalers, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon provide digital cloud services through Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), respectively. The computing power is housed in massive warehouse-like buildings known as data centers. There are economies of scale in the business, meaning the cost per unit gets cheaper as the size increases. For example, this means that for a company like Netflix, the cost to outsource the hosting of its streaming videos to AWS is cheaper than hosting the data in-house.

November 30, 2022, was the widespread launch of ChatGPT. In only 5 days, it hit 1 million users. As of November 2025, monthly active users reached 810 million. Accommodating the growth of ChatGPT, as well as other new AI models such as Claude, Gemini and Grok, has led to massive new capex spending on the part of the hyperscalers. According to Wired:

The amount of capital pouring into AI data center projects is staggering. Last week, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon reported their 2025 capital expenditures would total roughly $370 billion, and they expect that number to keep rising in 2026. The biggest spender last quarter was Microsoft, which put nearly $35 billion into data centers and other investments, equivalent to 45 percent of its revenue.
Rarely, if ever, has a single technology absorbed this much money this quickly. Warnings of an AI bubble are getting louder every day, but whether or not a crash eventually happens, the frenzy is already reshaping the US economy. Harvard economist Jason Furman estimates that investment in data centers and software processing technology accounted for nearly all of US GDP growth in the first half of 2025.
In the past four quarters, capex spending and growth for Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon have been as follows:

64.58%","This question resolves as the combined capital expenditures (capex) for Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon reported for the quarter ending December 31, 2025, according to each company's earnings report or SEC filings. ","For purposes of this question, capex is defined as a company's reported cash outflows for purchases of or additions to property, plant and equipment (PP&E), netted against any inflows tied to PP&E such as proceeds from disposals of property and equipment, and then multiplied by -1. 
Mathematically, this is expressed as:          

Capexi​=−(Outi​+Ini​),for i∈{MSFT,GOOG,AMZN} 
Where:
Outi  = PP&E purchases or additions
Ini = PP&E proceeds or incentives (0 if not separately reported)

This information is reported in each company's cash flow statement under investing activities. For example:
In its quarter ended September 30, 2025, Microsoft reported Additions to property and equipment of $-19.394 billion with no separate entry for inflows from disposals. Thus, its capex for the quarter was $19.394 billion.
In its quarter ended September 30, 2025, Alphabet reported Purchases of property and equipment of $-23.953 billion and no separate entry for inflows from disposals. Its capex was $23.953 billion. 
In its quarter ended September 30, 2025, Amazon reported Purchases of property and equipment of $-35.095 billion and Proceeds from property and equipment sales and incentives of $867 million. Adding the numbers and multiplying by -1 equals capex of $34.228 billion.
The combined capex for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 was therefore $77.575 billion. ",2026-02-04,2026-02-07,Yes,N/A

In addition, Norway won the highest rank in the medal table at the 2018 Winter Olympics and in 2014. Typically ranking in the top 5 have been Germany, Canada and the United States. Perennial contender Russia will not be participating due to an IOC ban following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, although a handful of Russian athletes will participate as individual neutral athletes. Finally, there is strong academic evidence that the Olympic host country has a significant advantage, with this year's host being Italy. ","This question will resolve as the country whose athletes have won the most gold medals at the 2026 Winter Olympics. If two or more countries are tied for first on gold medals, this question will resolve as the country among them with the most silver medals; if still tied, the country with the most bronze medals.","If a country other than one of the ones listed wins, the question resolves as Other. 
In the event of countries tied for first with equal numbers of gold, silver and bronze medals, then for purposes of this question the tiebreaker will be the country that comes first alphabetically according to its International Olympic Committee country code.

40927,"Will André Ventura win Portugal's 2026 presidential election?",https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40927/will-andre-ventura-win-portugals-2026-presidential-election/,"Portugal was one of the last dictatorships in western Europe, with the 1974 Carnation Revolution overthrowing the nationalist regime founded by Antonio de Oliveira Salazar in 1933. Since then, Portugal has held 10 presidential elections, with the country today having a score of 96/100 with Freedom House, one of the highest in the world.

In the 2020s, Portuguese politics has focused on COVID, immigration, violent crime and a soaring cost of living, especially a severe lack of affordable housing. According to a recent poll of registered voters, the most important issues were healthcare (37%), migration policy (9%), and housing policy (8%).

Portugal's next presidential election is scheduled for January 18, 2026, with a potential runoff election on February 8, 2026. Some recent polls just before the first round can be found below:

Gouveia e Melo, an independent candidate, was Chief of Naval Staff, the top position in the Portuguese Navy. Melo took on a high-profile role during the COVID pandemic as head of Portugal's vaccination task force, and under his leadership the country vaccinated 98% of its eligible population. He has wide name recognition in Portugal, and was previously widely known as the favorite to win.

Rising in the polls recently has been Andre Ventura, founder of the far-right Chega Party, which supports a crackdown on crime, opposes multiculturalism, and has called for the deportation of illegal immigrants who commit crimes or who are economically inactive. 

Another contender is António José Seguro, a member of the Socialist Party who was previous Secretary–general of the party from 2011-2024. After largely remaining out of the limelight since then, he has positioned himself as the progressive standard-bearer in the race.

An additional challenger is Luís Marques Mendes, who is the former head of the ruling Social Democratic Party and is returning to politics after a long stint as a lawyer and political commentator and has positioned himself as a centrist on many issues.

",https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40726/new-nvda-record-close-in-february-2026/,"Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, with 70-95% market share depending on how it is measured. As such, it has been the poster boy of the AI boom. Microsoft spends a full 47% of its capital expenditures on Nvidia chips, Amazon 11%, Meta 25%, Alphabet 15% and Tesla 13%. Many big tech companies also rent data centers from CoreWeave, which itself spends billions on Nvidia chips. 
In the year through December 3, 2025, Nvidia’s stock price was up 30%. During that period, the trailing month's closing high averaged 19% higher than the trailing month's closing low.
Nvidia’s business has been firing on all cylinders, selling every one of its flagship Blackwell chips it can make, and with demand projected by analysts to exceed supply well into fiscal year 2026. However, new business challenges have presented themselves. First, Nvidia faces massive uncertainty in China, with the US in November 2025 announcing restrictions on sales of scaled-down Nvidia chips to the country, while China itself has banned Nvidia chips from new data centers. Secondly, Google is ramping up its Ironwood TPU chips, which compete favorably on many metrics with Blackwell.
Twenty-six years of Nvidia's stock price history is available from MacroTrends. The highest close price NVDA has ever reached was 207.03 on October 29, 2025.","This question resolves as Yes if Nvidia’s stock closes at greater than any previous close price for any regular trading day after January 31, 2026 and before March 1, 2026, according to Yahoo Finance.","The Adj Close price of Yahoo Finance will be used to resolve this question.
If Yahoo Finance is unavailable or proves to be unreliable, alternative credible sources may be used.

Governments often issue bonds to finance debt and in turn these bonds are then resold on the open market at a floating rate.
The 10-Year Bond Yield is typically considered the benchmark of any government's long term borrowing costs. Higher values generally indicate expectations of higher economic growth but also can indicate a lack of confidence in the lender's ability to repay its loans.
During 2025, Germany dramatically increased military spending, creating an exception to the strict debt brake, allowing the increase to be financed through debt. 
Although increasing debt generally leads to higher yields, it has also led to more liquidity in the historically tight market.

By contrast the S&P 500 was up 17.66% YTD, with dividends included.
A spreadsheet with the history of prices from August 30, 2000 to December 19, 2025 can be found here. 
Gold, a rare metal both on earth and throughout the universe, has been widely used throughout human history both as a medium of exchange and as a store of reserve value. Where gold comes from is actually unknown, with the prevailing theory being that it is ejected from explosions of a certain highly magnetized type of neutron star called a magnetar.
Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, has explained the long-term value of gold as follows: 
Gold has also been a favored money because it has lower confiscation risks than other monies and other assets. That’s because it doesn’t depend on getting money from someone, and it’s tougher for someone or some government to take it from you. It is the toughest money to grab because it can be held in one’s own secure possession, unlike all other monies that require others to make payments of money to give them value. It can’t be stolen in cyberattacks. For this reason, gold has been the favored asset when there were big risks of money confiscations due to a) financial crises that led to very high taxes and other confiscatory policies and/or b) economic and monetary wars between countries (e.g., sanctions).
As a result, during times when there were monetary/debt crises and/or wars that increased the risks of confiscation, gold went up a lot in value (or, said more accurately, it was the money that didn’t fall in value). This is why gold has continued to be the most fundamental money over time, with the best track record of having its value keep pace with the cost of living over very long periods of time.

",This question will resolve as the highest price of gold displayed by Yahoo Finance for any day in February 2026.,"Specifically, the highest value shown in the ""High"" column will be used to resolve this question.

Argentina's government has historically kept the value of the peso artificially high through a government set exchange rate. In 2023, Argentine voters elected Javier Milei to the presidency, on a platform that included extreme economic reforms. Once in office, one of Milei's first actions was to cut the official value of the Argentine peso in half.
Inflation soared higher for the first few months of Milei's presidency, peaking in April 2024, before beginning a descent, that would eventually bring Argentina's inflation rate to its lowest level in years. Although the inflation rate has started to trend upward again, it remains low by recent standards.
The peso has however continued to lose value against the dollar. When Milei took office, one U.S. dollar cost 366 pesos. At the beginning of his ""shock therapy"" program, the figure was dramatically increased to 800 pesos. By April 2024, the exchange rate was Arg$861; by April 2025, Arg$1,074.
On April 11, 2025, Argentina adopted an exchange rate band regime, in which the central bank would aim to keep the exchange rate between Arg$1,000 and Arg$1,400, by buying and selling pesos as necessary to control the currency's value. For the rest of 2025, the exchange rate continued to increase, exceeding 1,400 for much of the last few months. Then on December 15, 2025, the BCRA announced that the currency bands would themselves begin to be adjusted upward.
As of January 23, 2026, the closing exchange rate was 1,429.2451 pesos per U.S. dollar, with the exchange rate band currently having an upper limit of 1,543.7100 and a lower limit of 905.8600.

Regarding the recent performance of AI-related stocks in the S&P 500, Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, wrote in November 2025:
Meanwhile, the stock market and wealth boom are highly concentrated in the top AI-related stocks (e.g., the Mag 7) and with a small group of very rich people, and AI is replacing people and increasing both the wealth/money gap and the wealth gap between people. Having seen this dynamic many times in history, I think that there is a significant likelihood of a big political and social backlash that will, at a minimum, significantly change wealth distribution and, at a maximum, could produce severe social and political disorder.
That same month, Dalio went on CNBC and described AI as a ""bubble,"" noting however that in his view it is not possible to time the pricking of the bubble, and that the AI stocks may keep going up for awhile, until at some point investors may have a strong need for cash.

According to the Bridgewater report We’re All Mercantilists Now, the US could take strong steps to narrow its deficit:
Now the views of key Trump advisors like former US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are becoming more widely shared: trade deficits are a transfer of wealth to other countries, tariffs are necessary to defend US workers from “beggar thy neighbor” industrial policies of countries like China, and a robust manufacturing base is critical for future productivity growth and national defense.
According to Lighthizer, one of the architects of President Donald J. Trump's trade policies (italics in original):
“What we have seen in recent decades is countries adopting industrial policies that are designed not to raise their standard of living but to increase exports—in order both to accumulate assets abroad and to establish their advantage in leading edge industries...These are the beggar-thy-neighbor policies that were condemned early in the last century. Countries that run consistently large surpluses are the protectionists in the global economy…The US could use tariffs to offset the unfair industrial policies of the predators.”
As of the latest data release in December 2025, the US's largest trade deficit was with China, with China alone making up 18.19% of the entire goods trade deficit of the United State, according to Monthly Trade Update by the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress:

41603,How much in goods will the US export in December 2025?,https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41603/us-exported-goods-in-dec-2025/,"According to Bridgewater in their We’re All Mercantilists Now report:

By “modern mercantilism,” we mean the following:
1) The state has a large role in orchestrating the economy to increase national wealth and strength.
2) Trade balances are an important determinant of national wealth and strength, and trade deficits are to be avoided.
3) Industrial policy is used to promote self-reliance and defense.
4) National corporate champions are protected.
Recent reports such as Bridgewater's How Canada Is Responding to American Mercantilism argue that responses by other countries to the new tariffs (as high as 35% on certain Canadian goods) are creating a lot of volatility:

This reorientation of trade policy, not just with the US’s traditional adversaries but with some of its closest allies, has been disruptive to existing economic relationships
Canada, which Bridgewater describes as having ""outsize exposure to the US,"" has responded to US tariffs by a combination of its own counter-tariffs and a re-orientation of trade to diversify away from the US.

In 2024 and 2025, goods exports by the US have been as follows:

It consists of route-specific indices plus a composite index, and is quoted in US dollars per 40-foot container (FEU).
In the WCI methodology, the “agreed freight rate” is intended to reflect the total ocean freight including bunker adjustment and other applicable surcharges, and terminal handling charges where commonly included by market practice, while excluding inland transportation-related surcharges. “Spot” in this context denotes short-term market pricing that can change rapidly with capacity and demand conditions, as opposed to longer-duration contract rates.
Drewry publishes weekly index values for Shanghai-Los Angeles, Shanghai-New York, Shanghai-Genoa, and Shanghai-Rotterdam
Container shipping rates from Shanghai fell steadily in early 2025, spiked sharply in late May–June, then declined through autumn before a modest recovery toward early 2026, with Shanghai–Los Angeles consistently priced above Shanghai–Rotterdam.
Although all prices reflect global container market conditions, each is also sensitive to lane-specific operational factors. Since late 2023, a prominent driver for Asia-Europe pricing has been the Red Sea security disruption, which led many carriers to reroute voyages around the Cape of Good Hope, increasing sailing distance and vessel time requirements. 
By January 2026, some major carriers began resuming Red Sea and Suez transits on certain services as security conditions appeared to improve, which analysts noted could reduce transit times and put downward pressure on freight rates","This question will resolve as the value of the Drewry World Container Index for the Shanghai to Los Angeles route minus the value for the Shanghai to Rotterdam route on March 5, 2026.","This question will resolve as the values for March 5 when accessed first by Metaculus on or after March 6.

During 2025, the price has continued to increase, reaching a peak of ¥4,444/5kg during November 2025.
Precipitated by the 2023 Asia heatwave and subsequent decline in rice production, the sustained price surge has been attributed to increasing demand, environmental changes, panic buying and many other things. Japan's Gentan system, intended to encourage self-sufficiency and protect farmers has been criticised as contributing to fragility in the market and leading to high prices.

Will the United States gain less than 100,000 new nonfarm jobs between December 2025 and February 2026?


CHILD QUESTION:
What will be the closing value of the S&P 500 on March 13, 2026?
",https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41348/conditional-what-will-sp-500-close-at-on-march-13-2026/,"PARENT BACKGROUND INFO: Every month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the total number of ""nonfarm"" employees in the U.S. economy; the total number of workers, not counting farm employees, household employees, the self-employed, and volunteers. For decades, outside of periods of recession, this number has gone steadily up. Unemployment and the stock market have historically been closely correlated: when unemployment goes down, the stock market goes up, and vice versa.
Since 2022 however, employment growth has slowed while the stock market has continued to rise. This unprecedented phenomenon has been attributed to the post-pandemic increase in interest rates and the contemporaneous AI-related stock boom (which some fear is a bubble).
In November 2025, the seasonally adjusted number of nonfarm employees was 159.552 million. Previous values are available from FRED.
CHILD BACKGROUND INFO: The S&P 500 is a stock market index that tracks the stock prices of 500 companies that are publicly traded in the United States. Its performance is widely followed and often used as a proxy for the overall performance of the U.S. stock market.
From 2023 through 2025, the S&P 500 saw significant gains as AI-related stocks surged in value. In 2024 alone, the index reached for the first time both the 5000- and the 6000-point marks, and although it dipped in the first two months of the new administration, the index has continued to rise in 2025, closing at an all-time high (as of this writing) of 6,932.05 on December 24, 2025.
Prognosticators expect the S&P 500 to continue to grow in 2026, albeit not at the rates seen in any of the previous three years, with ""waning enthusiasm for A.I. and a drop in tech valuations"" seen as the top threat to the market's continued growth.","PARENT RESOLUTION CRITERIA:This question will resolve as Yes if the seasonally adjusted number of nonfarm employees for February 2026, minus the seasonally adjusted number of nonfarm employees for December 2025, according to FRED, is less than 100 thousand.
This question will resolve using the numbers from the Employment Situation for February 2026. Therefore, it will most probably use the initial estimates for February and the revised estimates for December 2025.

After roughly 20 years of flat or minimal growth in U.S. electricity demand, power needs are rising and are expected to surge in the next several decades.
 Since the AI boom accelerated with the 2022 launch of ChatGPT, there has been a great expansion in power-hungry data centers housing the hardware that runs AI:
The large, boxy data center buildings filled with computer servers consumed more than 4 percent of the nation’s electricity in 2023. Government analysts estimate that will increase to as much as 12 percent in just three years. That’s because computers that train A.I. systems consume much more electricity than those used for popular internet services like Netflix or TikTok.
To meet that demand, energy companies have rushed to build more power plants and power lines.
In 2025, five-year plan capex increases of at least $5 billion, with data center electricity demand as the driver of the increased spending, were announced by the following electric utility companies: 
February 12, 2025: Dominion Energy announces an increase of almost $7 billion, due to data centers contracting 19 GW.
February 13, 2025: Duke Energy raises its capex plan by about $10 billion ""to accommodate rising demand from population growth in the U.S. Southeast and the expansion of data centers and advanced manufacturing, the company said.""

41511,What will be the ratio of search interest between Google and ChatGPT in the first two weeks of March 2026?,https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41511/googlechatgpt-trends-ratio-in-early-march-2026/,"Since ChatGPT was released in late 2022, an increasing number of people have started using it as a substitute to typical search engines. This prompted Google to issue a 'code red', before following up with their own large language model. However, as of late 2025, ChatGPT posed no threat to Google search with a minority of ChatGPT prompts being ""search-like"" and Google processing vastly more searches per day.
Nevertheless, ChatGPT's popularity has been rapidly increasing, with Google's search interest advantage having shrunk from more than 8x to less than 2x over the past few years, The chart supports this narrative: Google maintains higher overall search interest, but ChatGPT’s interest has risen sharply since 2023, steadily narrowing the gap. By late 2025, Google’s advantage has fallen from overwhelming dominance to a much smaller lead, reflecting ChatGPT’s rapid growth without yet displacing traditional search.","This question will resolve as the listed value that is closest to the ratio of the average worldwide Google Trends interest for Google (Topic) vs ChatGPT (Software) between March 1 and March 14, 2026.","If two values are equidistant from the ratio, this question will resolve as the higher value of the two. For example, if Google's interest is 98 and ChatGPT's is 80, resulting in a ratio of 1.225, which is equidistant from 1.2 and 1.25, this question will resolve as 1.25. 
To calculate the resolution, Metaculus will perform the following steps:
Access the site from a location in the US Central Timezone (Metaculus expects to use Omaha, Nebraska and the surrounding areas as the precise location).
Go to the Classic Explore version of the site, as opposed to the Gemini-assisted Explore.
Set Google (Topic) and ChatGPT (Software) as the search terms.
Set region to Worldwide.
Set the custom time range to March 1, 2026 - March 14, 2026.
Set categories to All categories and search to Web Search.
Ensure that data for March 14, 2026 is not partial.
Divide the Average value for Google by the Average value for ChatGPT that are presented in the bar chart besides the trends graph.
Please note that there might be variations in the data reported by Google depending on the time zone and location they are accessed from. This question will resolve according to the data as accessed by Metaculus using the above options.",2026-02-28,2026-03-15,No,in 2 weeks
41362,"How much will Wuthering Heights and Hoppers gross domestically during their opening weekend?",https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41362/wuthering-heights-hoppers-opening-weekend/,"
In recent years, theatrical ticket sales have been on the decline, with a sharp drop during COVID precipitating recent lows. Although sales are much higher than in 2020, overall domestic box office gross has failed to recover to pre-pandemic levels, with movie-goers spending roughly the same amount during 2024 and 2025.

Box office gross refers to revenue generated from a movie's theatrical release. Generally, domestic box office gross refers to earnings in the US and Canada.

Wuthering Heights (2026) is an upcoming psychological drama film loosely inspired by the 1847 novel of the same name. The film is scheduled for release in the United States on February 13, 2026. 

Hoppers is an upcoming animated action comedy film produced by Pixar. The film is scheduled for release in the United States on March 6, 2026.","Each subquestion will resolve as the gross domestic box office revenue that each film earns during its opening weekend.
The primary source for resolution will be Box Office Mojo (Hoppers, Wuthering Heights).","Box Office Mojo defines ""domestic"" as gross box-office revenue from North America (U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico). For simplicity, no attempt will be made to second-guess Box Office Mojo's definitions or methodologies, and this question will resolve based on the numbers it reports.

Omsk",https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41342/russian-refineries-hit-by-ukraine-before-mar-14-2026/,"Since 2023, Ukraine has conducted a sustained campaign of long-range drone and occasional missile strikes against Russian energy infrastructure, including oil refineries. Ukrainian officials and security-service sources have framed these attacks as an effort to degrade Russia’s war-funding base by reducing oil-product output and disrupting military fuel logistics, while Russia has described the strikes as terrorism and has continued its own large-scale attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid.
Since 2025 and particularly August, Ukraine has intensified attacks. The image illustrates a sharp escalation in Ukraine’s long-range strikes on Russian energy infrastructure in 2025, with attacks rising from sporadic incidents in early summer to a peak in August–September. This aligns with reporting that Ukraine has intensified drone attacks on major Russian oil refineries since August 2025 as part of a sustained effort to disrupt Russia’s energy revenues and military fuel supply.
This has continued in late 2025, with Ukraine-linked drone attacks striking multiple Russian refineries, including the Syzran refinery, Rosneft’s Ryazan refinery, and Lukoil’s large Nizhny Novgorod (Kstovo) refinery.","Each subquestion will resolve as Yes if, after January 19, 2026 and before March 14, 2026 Moscow Time, the corresponding Russian oil refinery has been hit by Ukraine, according to credible sources.
If neither Russia nor credible sources report a confirmed hit, a subquestion will still resolve as Yes if both (i) Ukraine claims it hit the corresponding refinery and (ii) Russia or credible sources report a physical incident at that refinery site consistent with an attack.","A ""hit"" includes physical attacks conducted using any method, including UAVs, missiles, sabotage, commando/ground raid, or planted explosives. A ""hit"" or ""physical incident"" will generally include cases that result in fire, explosion, damage, or an unplanned shutdown, even if there was no damage to equipment or personnel reported.
Attempted attacks that miss or are intercepted without a physical incident at the refinery do not count.

In April 2013, under the Barack Obama administration, the United States imposed sanctions on numerous Russian officials under the Magnitsky Act, which had been signed into law the previous year. Then, in March 2014, the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on numerous Russian officials in connection with the Russian occupation of Crimea. (The US ultimately imposed multiple rounds of sanctions related to that conflict.) And in December 2016, President Obama imposed additional sanctions on Russia in connection with the country's alleged interference in the 2016 US elections.
In 2017, Donald Trump came to power, taking a notably more conciliatory approach toward Russia than his predecessor had. Nevertheless, in July 2017, Congress passed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which imposed new sanctions on Russia for its activities relating to Ukraine, Syria, and the 2016 election. Though he criticized the legislation as flawed, President Trump signed it into law. The Trump administration subsequently imposed numerous other sanctions relating to Russia.
In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, triggering ""the most severe economic sanctions ever levied on Russia."" And as that conflict drags on, sanctions remain a key component of US foreign policy vis-à-vis Russia. On December 17, 2025, Reuters reported that the Trump administration was preparing an additional round of sanctions on Russia to pressure it to negotiate a peace with Ukraine.","This question will resolve as Yes if, after January 12, 2026 and before March 14, 2026 ET, the US government announces via binding legal action a new or expanded sanctions-related restriction on Russian persons or entities and the official announcement explicitly states it is related to the Ukraine war.
Sanctions include, but are not limited to asset freezes, transaction bans, trade restrictions, Entity List-type actions, or visa/entry restrictions, and they might be issued by OFAC, the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, the White House, or Congress.
Actions not explicitly linked to the war in the official announcements or press materials do not count, even if plausibly war-motivated.","An example of an action that would count is OFAC's October 22, 2025 issuance of new sanctions targeting Russian oil companies (including Lukoil and Rosneft), with the accompanying press release stating that it is doing so ""as a result of Russia’s lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine.""",2026-03-10,2026-03-14,No,in 2 weeks

Initially, these rules were not aimed at restricting China's capacity to train large language models. However, they directly restricted the class of high-end GPUs that subsequently became central to generative AI, leading to an eventual shift in the controls' focus to encompass such issues.
In response to these restrictions, NVIDIA repeatedly designed China-specific variants of its chips that complied with the export controls. These initially included the A800 and H800 chips, which were later banned after an update to the export regulations, and then the H20, which was only briefly restricted in early 2025. In late 2025, reporting indicated the US planned to block a new, highly capable China-specific chip referred to as B30A. Subsequently, however, President Trump announced, in a policy shift, that the US would permit exports of the powerful H200 chip to China, subject to a 25% fee.","This question will resolve as Yes if, after January 12, 2026 and before March 14, 2026 ET, the US government publicly states that it will permit any Nvidia GPU that is better than the H200 to be exported to mainland China.

Generally, CPI refers to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (All Items), also called CPI-U. A commonly reported sub-index of CPI is core CPI, which omits food and energy. The chart below compares CPI and core CPI from 1957 to 2025:
U.S. CPI and core CPI have increased steadily over time, closely tracking each other, with a noticeable acceleration after 2020. Core CPI is slightly smoother than headline CPI because it excludes volatile food and energy prices.
Food and energy prices are often volatile, so omitting them can yield a more accurate picture of long-term inflation trends. For September 2025, core CPI was 330.54, higher than it was for August by +0.2%. The chart below compares the monthly percentage change in CPI and core CPI from 1957 to 2025:
Monthly CPI and core CPI inflation show high volatility in the 1970s–early 1980s and during major shocks such as 2008 and 2020, but are generally lower and more stable in recent decades, with modest month-to-month changes by 2024–2025.
