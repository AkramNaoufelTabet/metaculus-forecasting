41934,When will the Supreme Court release its decision on presidential tariff authority in Learning Resources v. Trump?,https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41934/when-will-scotus-decide-learning-resources-v-trump/,"On April 2, 2025, a day he called ""Liberation Day,"" US President Donald J. Trump announced a series of massive tariff increases on imports from nearly all countries. Canada and Mexico for example, which had nearly tariff-free imports on most goods due to the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), had their tariffs raised to 25%. A 10% minimum tariff on all countries was imposed, which was still in effect as of January 2026. (See the Trump 2.0 tariff tracker by the Reed Smith law firm.)
Tariffs on China, one of the top exporters of goods to the US, were raised to 54% and then 7 days later to 145%.
Although the US Constitution grants Congress the power to levy tariffs, Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), signed by President Jimmy Carter in 1977, to give him broad authority to hike tariffs. The IEEPA gives the US president the power to regulate international commerce after declaring a national emergency in response to a threat to the US from abroad. In this case Trump declared an emergency based on ""harmful policies like currency manipulation and exorbitant value-added taxes (VAT) perpetuated by other countries.""
Learning Resources sells educational toys, many of which are manufactured in China. According to Oyez:
The petitioners filed suit on April 22, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the legality of the IEEPA tariffs. The district court granted a preliminary injunction on May 29, 2025, holding that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs and finding that the tariffs posed an existential threat to the petitioners. However, that ruling was stayed just days later, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit docketed the case. Meanwhile, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled similarly in related cases but its decision was also stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
The case reached the US Supreme Court on an accelerated track and was consolidated with another similar case. The Court held oral arguments in November 2025, at which legal observers described the Court as skeptical of Trump's authority under IEEPA.
At the time of this question, the Supreme Court is in recess, with the next set of rulings expected to be released on February 20, 2026, which may include the tariffs case.

40851,"Will Nvidia's revenue for the quarter ending January 25, 2026 exceed Nvidia's guidance by more than 5%?",https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40851/nvidias-2026q4-revenue-5-above-guidance/,"Nvidia, now the dominant chipmaker for AI data centers and a $4 trillion market cap company, was founded in 1993 from an idea for computer game chips hatched in a San Jose Denny's booth by one of its busboys, Jensen Huang, and two of his friends. In 2024, Nvidia replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a monumental moment given Intel's past dominance through Nvidia's early years.
Huang recently revealed a $500 billion order backlog through much of 2026 and that Nvidia was selling every chip it could make, particularly in data centers and with its new Blackwell chip. Despite its successes, Nvidia has also faced challenges getting US government approval selling its chips to the enormous China market, plus it is increasingly facing challenges from its largest customers, such as Google, Amazon, and potentially OpenAI, developing their own chips.
Traditionally Nvidia has been conservative in its guidance. In the most recent quarter, which ended October 26, 2025 (Nvidia's 3rd quarter of its fiscal year 2026), Nvidia reported $57 billion in revenues, which exceeded its guidance for the quarter, $54 billion, by 5.6%.

41697,What will US manufacturing construction spending be in December 2025?,https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41697/us-manufacturing-construction-spending-dec-2025/,"According to Bridgewater's We’re All Mercantilists Now report, the world is increasingly entering a mercantilist era in which nation-states promote their own interests over globalism and global free trade. As part of that, ""Industrial policy is used to promote self-reliance and defense.""
This new industrial policy to develop America's manufacturing began in earnest with the first administration of Donald Trump, continued under Joe Biden, and is accelerating under the new Trump administration. The goals are said to be to reduce supply-chain dependencies on geopolitical rivals such as China and to reduce trade deficits:
The recent increase in industrial policy support under the Biden administration through measures like the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act have caused spending on manufacturing construction in the US to nearly double.
According to the US Census Bureau in its methodology definitions, construction consists of the total value of work done (labor, planning, cost of materials, etc.) on new buildings, expansions or renovations of existing buildings, and certain fixed equipment. It does not include non-fixed equipment, machinery, land, or maintenance.
Historically, the US following World War II experienced a long-term decline in the portion of its economy devoted to manufacturing, as the service sector rose in importance and manufacturing was outsourced to lower wage countries such as Mexico and China. After bottoming out in the early 2000s, in recent decades the US has experienced a resurgence in construction at manufacturing sites, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic:","This question resolves as the annualized, seasonally adjusted amount of construction spending in the United States attributed to manufacturing for December 2025, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau in its Monthly Construction Spending release.","The number can typically be found in Table 1. Value of Construction Put in Place in the United States, Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate, under the row labelled Manufacturing under Total Construction. For example, the value reported in the August 2025 release was $220,402 ($220,402 million or $220.402 billion).

- Amazon: $2.54 T (annual report)
- Apple: $4.03 T (annual report)
- Meta Platforms: $1.54 T (annual report)
- Microsoft: $3.79 T (annual report)
- Tesla: $1.34 T (annual report)
Total market cap: $21.23 T
The total S&P 500 market cap was $56.90 trillion as of November 16, 2025, which means the Magnificent Seven are 37% of the index. This is up from 35% a year ago and 29% two years ago. In 2024, the Magnificent Seven were responsible for over half of the S&P 500's gains for the year, and this continued in 2025 through the end of October.
Zooming out further, in the decade through the end of 2025, the Magnificent Seven have beaten the rest of the S&P 500 by a significant margin:
The chart shows cumulative returns from 2015 to 2025, comparing the Magnificent Seven versus the rest of the S&P 500 (S&P 493).
Starting from a similar base in 2015, the Magnificent Seven significantly outperform over the decade. Their cumulative return rises steadily through 2018, accelerates after 2020, experiences a sharp drawdown in 2022, and then rebounds strongly from 2023 onward, reaching roughly 12–13× cumulative return by 2025.
In contrast, the S&P 493 shows much more modest growth over the same period. Returns increase gradually, dip slightly around 2022, and recover afterward, ending near approximately 2.5–3× cumulative return by 2025.
Overall, the visualization highlights a persistent and widening performance gap: over the decade, the Magnificent Seven deliver multiple times the cumulative return of the rest of the S&P 500, illustrating the extreme concentration of market leadership and gains within a small group of mega-cap technology firms.","This question resolves as the combined market capitalization of the following seven companies, in trillions of US dollars, according to CompaniesMarketCap when first accessed by Metaculus after 4:00 PM Eastern on Friday, March 13, 2026:

This system requires computers to solve complex computational puzzles in order to create new Bitcoin and in turn verify transactions made between users.
A hash rate is a measure of computational power used in such as system. Because the system automatically adjusts the difficulty to maintain a consistent rate of transactions, the more computational power dedicated to the system, the more power it takes to create a given amount of Bitcoin.
As Bitcoin's price has skyrocketed, a steadily increasing amount of computation has been dedicated to the network, reaching over 10^21 hashes (or 1 zettahash) per second during late 2025. The network uses an immense amount of computation, the equivalent of trillions of consumer GPUs, and expends more power than many mid-sized countries.

Various crude oil benchmarks are used in global markets, including most notably Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate.
Both benchmark crudes are considered light and sweet oils, making them easier to refine into gasoline. And although WTI is lighter and sweeter than Brent, the more relevant distinction may be where the oils originate. Brent, which is produced in the North Sea region, is the common benchmark for Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, including OPEC. WTI, by contrast, is drilled on land in the United States and is the common benchmark for the U.S. market.
In the past, Brent Crude, which was easier to transport to market by dint of its extraction location, was cheaper than WTI. More recently, however, technological advances in drilling have significantly reduced the cost of production in the U.S., causing WTI to trade more cheaply than Brent. Geopolitical developments can also affect one region's oil prices more than another's, causing temporary increases in the price spread.
Historic spot prices for Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate are available online from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.","This question will resolve as the spot price of Brent Crude oil minus the spot price of West Texas Intermediate oil on March 4, 2026, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.","On the EIA website, Brent Crude is labelled as ""Brent - Europe"" while West Texas Intermediate is labelled as ""WTI - Cushing, Oklahoma"".

China’s emergence as an economically powerful strategic competitor to the US worries many in the free world. It has raised concerns about supply-chain dependencies, the lack of robust manufacturing, and an ailing defense industrial base. The political and social consequences of lost domestic manufacturing jobs are leading policy makers to second-guess whether cheaper consumer goods and a more market-efficient allocation of capital are worth it.
Since the end of World War II, the long-term story of America has been an ever-grinding decline in manufacturing jobs as a percentage of overall employment:
In absolute numbers, the story has been a bit more complicated, with numbers actually peaking in 1979 at over 19 million. The largest numbers of jobs have been lost in fabricated metals and machinery, computer and electrical products, and the apparel and textile industries. The bulk of these manufacturing jobs moved to China, which now has almost triple the production of the US.
On April 2025, two and a half months after he began his second term, President Donald Trump declared a ""national emergency"" to prioritize re-shoring of manufacturing, using tariffs to encourage domestic production.

The state is ruled by The Greens, a socially liberal party favoring social and environmental justice. The 2021 election results were:
| Party | Votes | % |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alliance 90/The Greens (GRÜNE) | 1,586,192 | 32.6 |
| Christian Democratic Union (CDU) | 1,168,975 | 24.1 |

| The Left (LINKE) | 173,317 | 3.6 |
| Free Voters (FW) | 146,259 | 3.0 |
In early 2021, the most important issue to German voters was the COVID-19 pandemic. The Greens took an aggressive stance against the spread of the virus, pushing for immediate mandatory working from home, virus rapid-testing at home, and widespread distribution and usage of N95-equivalent masks.
At the end of 2025, the most important issues to German voters according to Ipsos were crime & violence, with migration as a close second. Among voters who named migration as their most important issue, the far-right AfD dominates, with 69% of its voters choosing that as top priority for politicians. AfD has made “remigration” or deportation of German residents or even citizens with a migration background, a part of its platform. In 2024, 18% of Baden-Württemberg’s population were foreign nationals, specifically Baden has long been a popular destination for migrants.
Another dynamic impacting the state is the youth vote, with the voting age lowered to 16. Young voters have been powering the rise of parties on both the left and right at the expense of the more centrist parties of their elders. On the left the democratic socialist Die Linke received 25% of the vote from 18-24 year-olds in the 2025 German federal election. On the right, the AfD won 21% of the youth vote, up from 21% in 2021. There is also significant gender differences, with 25% of men under 25 voting for the AfD, while only 14% of women that age did.

41699,Will U.S. consumer sentiment in March 2026 be higher than in February 2026?,https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41699/us-consumer-sentiment-increase-feb-to-mar-2026/,"For decades, the University of Michigan has tracked consumer confidence among the United States public. Broadly understood, consumer confidence is meant to measure how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are feeling about the state of the economy at large as well as about their personal financial situation. High consumer confidence is thought to lead to increased spending, whereas low consumer confidence would lead to increased saving, in either case affecting the broader economy.
Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index is a monthly measure that is normalized to have had a value of 100 at the beginning of 1966. In recent years, the value has been considerably lower, and the index trended downward over the course of 2025. That said, the preliminary value for January 2026 (54.0) is higher than the final value for December 2025 (52.9).
The chart illustrates the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index from 2023 through early 2026. Over this period, sentiment exhibits notable volatility. In 2023, the index fluctuates in the low-to-mid 60s, reflecting uneven consumer perceptions amid inflation concerns and monetary tightening.
In 2024, consumer sentiment improves markedly, reaching local peaks near the high 70s, indicating a temporary resurgence of optimism about economic conditions and household finances. However, this improvement proves short-lived.
During 2025, the index declines sharply, falling from the low 70s to the low 50s, marking a significant deterioration in consumer confidence. This downturn suggests rising pessimism, likely associated with cost-of-living pressures, economic uncertainty, and concerns about future income and employment prospects.
Toward the end of 2025 and into early 2026, sentiment stabilizes at historically low levels. While the preliminary January 2026 reading of 54.0 represents a modest increase compared to December 2025’s final value of 52.9, overall confidence remains well below long-term norms, underscoring persistent consumer caution despite the slight uptick.
Each month, the University of Michigan releases a preliminary value during the beginning of the month and a final value during the end of the month.","This question will resolve as Yes if the preliminary value of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for March 2026 is greater than the final value of the Consumer Sentiment Index for February 2026, according to the data on the University of Michigan website.","This question will resolve based on the preliminary value for March. It will use the latest available estimate for February published at that time.
